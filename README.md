As we peer deeper into the cosmos, we go back in time to the early days of our Universe enabling us to study its origins and answer questions related to dark matter, dark energy, supermassive blackholess,etc. But the signal after travelling for billions of years has become weak and falls in the lower frequency range. To extract and analyse such a signal, we need to design an approporiate feed antenna.
The 250–500 MHz band is ideal for studying redshifted neutral hydrogen (HI) from the distant Universe (z ≈ 1.8–1.8), enabling large-scale structure mapping from the epoch when galaxies were assembling, as well as detecting low-frequency pulsar emissions, solar bursts, and synchrotron radiation from supernova remnants or active galactic nuclei. The 1–1.5 GHz band covers the HI rest frequency at 1420.4 MHz for mapping hydrogen in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, measuring galactic rotation curves, and performing precision pulsar timing, while also overlapping with the “water hole” region for SETI searches. Together, these bands let you probe both the nearby and distant Universe, tracing hydrogen from our Galaxy to billions of light-years away while capturing diverse astrophysical radio sources.

Antennas radiate due to currents. Therefore, antenna design involves controlling these currents to achieve a desired radiation pattern. Conversely, in circuits, the goal is often to prevent radiation from currents. Radiation occurs when a current is physically separated from its return current. To minimize unwanted radiation, the design principle is to keep these two currents in close proximity.
Antennas serve a dual purpose: they convert bound circuit fields into propagating electromagnetic waves and, conversely, collect power from incoming electromagnetic waves. According to Maxwell's equations, any time-varying electric or magnetic field generates the opposing field, forming an electromagnetic wave. This wave is characterized by its two fields being oriented perpendicularly to each other, propagating in a direction normal to the plane defined by these perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, any circuit with time-varying fields inherently possesses some capacity for radiation. Antennas emit spherical waves that spread radially from their center. At significant distances, these spherical waves can be approximated as plane waves. While plane waves simplify problem-solving, they are not physically realistic because they would necessitate infinite power.
The Poynting vector describes both the direction of propagation and the power density of the electromagnetic wave.

S = E × H∗ W/m2

Radiation intensity depends only on the direction of radiation and remains the same at all distances. A probe antenna measures the relative radiation intensity (pattern) by moving in a circle (constant R) around the antenna. Patterns are measured by using three scales: (1) linear (power), (2) square root (field intensity), and (3) decibels (dB). The dB scale is used the most because it reveals more of the low-level responses (sidelobes).

Antenna Gain and Directivity : Antenna gain quantifies an antenna's ability to focus input power into radiation in a specific direction, measured at the peak radiation intensity. For aperture antennas like horn, parabolic reflector, or flat-plate arrays, the effective area is the physical area multiplied by the aperture efficiency. This efficiency is typically reduced by material, distribution, and mismatch losses, resulting in an estimated aperture efficiency of 55% for a parabolic reflector.
Directivity measures the concentration of radiation in a particular direction. The maximum directivity is calculated as the ratio of maximum radiation intensity to average radiation intensity (Umax / U0).

Antenna Characterization: G/T Ratio and Noise Temperature
Antennas are characterized by their G/T ratio, a measure independent of transmitter power and path loss, which incorporates receiver noise characteristics. The input noise temperature is calculated from component noise temperatures and gains, using the input of the first device as the noise reference point, as follows:

T = T1 + T2/G1+ T3/G1G2 + T4/G1G2G3 + ...

While choosing parameters for designing the antenna Wolfram alpha sotware was used for calculations.
